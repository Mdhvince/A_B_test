    "\n",
    "**Steps**:\n",
    "- Randomly take 2 sets of users: 1 for the control set (existing feature), the other for the experiment set (new feature)\n",
    "- Evaluate how differently answers users are to determine the best version of the feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "**We can't use A/B Test when**:\n",
    "- Results may take too long to have\n",
    "- No data available for the experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "**In practice**:\n",
    "* Construct the user flow (the customer funnel)\n",
    "* Choose a metric :\n",
    "    - Click through rate: `nbClick/nbPageView`, to know usability of a feature\n",
