    "**Steps**:\n",
    "- Randomly take 2 sets of users: 1 for the control set (existing feature), the other for the experiment set (new feature)\n",
    "- Evaluate how differently answers users are to determine the best version of the feature.\n",

    "**In practice**:\n",
    "* Construct the user flow (the customer funnel)\n",
    "* Choose a metric :\n",
    "    - Click through rate: `nbClick/nbPageView`, to know usability of a feature\n",
